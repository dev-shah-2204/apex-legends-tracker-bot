# Apex Legends Tracker for Discord

The game Apex Legends doesn't have an official API, so I'm using the API provided by https://apexlegendsapi.com </br>
It provides limited data but it's good enough.

Config Vars: </br>
```
APEX_LEGENDS_API_KEY   - The API key
APEX_LEGENDS_BOT_TOKEN - The bot's token
ERROR_CHANNEL          - The ID of the channel where you want to review unhandled errors
```
